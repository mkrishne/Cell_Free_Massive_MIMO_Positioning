# Cell-Free Massive MIMO Positioning

This repository contains the MATLAB and Python code associated with the following papers:

- **Hybrid Fingerprint-based Positioning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems**
- **Distributed Machine Learning Approach for Low-Latency Localization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems**

## Requirements

To run the MATLAB simulations, the following MATLAB toolboxes are required:

1. Signal Processing Toolbox  
2. Phased Array Toolbox  
3. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox  
4. Deep Learning Toolbox  
5. Parallel Computing Toolbox

## Description

The simulations were executed in MATLAB, with key outputs and logs saved using the `diary` functionality. 

For visualization, Python was used to generate the plots. This allowed for greater flexibility and control over the plotting environment.

## Usage

1. **Run the MATLAB script associated with the figure you wish to reproduce from the corresponding paper.**. Each figure typically has a dedicated script or a well-documented section within the simulation folder for easy reference.
2. Use the outputs to generate plots using Python scripts in the `plot_scripts/` folder.
